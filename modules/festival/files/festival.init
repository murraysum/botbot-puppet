# WARNING: It is inherently insecure to run a festival instance as a
# server, mainly because it exposes the whole system to exploits which
# can be easily used by attackers to gain access to your
# computer. This is because of the inherent design of the festival
# server. Please use it only in a situation where you are sure that
# you will not be subjected to such an attack, or have adequate
# security precautions.

# This file has been provided as an example file for your use, should
# you wish to run festival as a server.

# NOTE: Not just anybody can connect to your server; the list of allowed
# hostnames is a regexp. Check /usr/share/festival/festival.scm for more
# helpful comments; add your settings to /etc/festival.scm.
